Description: A stack for deploying containerized applications in AWS Fargate.
             This stack runs containers in a public VPC subnet, and includes a
             public facing load balancer to register the services in.
Parameters:
  VpcId:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
    Description: Select a VPC that allows instances access to the Internet.
  SubnetId:
    Type: List<AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id>
    Description: Select two subnets in your selected VPC.

  # A security group for the containers we will run in Fargate.
  # Two rules, allowing network traffic from a public facing load
  # balancer and from other members of the security group.
  #
  # Remove any of the following ingress rules that are not needed.
  # If you want to make direct requests to a container using its
  # public IP address you'll need to add a security group rule
  # to allow traffic from all IP addresses.

  #   to the public, and is intended to route traffic to one or more public
  #   facing services.

  # A public facing load balancer, this is used for accepting traffic from the public
  # internet and directing it to public facing microservices
